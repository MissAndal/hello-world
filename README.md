# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.


My name is Violene Atieno Andal, a passionate and dedicated technology enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Great Lakes University of Kisumu. With a strong foundation in IT.
I have developed a keen interest in emerging technologies and their potential to solve real-world problems. Professionally, I work as a freelancer, offering a flexible and self-driven approach to technology solutions while continuously expanding my skill set.
Currently, I am advancing my knowledge in cloud computing through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) training program. This opportunity has deepened my understanding of scalable infrastructure and cloud-based development, preparing me for more complex and impactful roles in the tech industry.
As a tech professional with a growing portfolio, I actively share my work and projects on GitHub at MissAndal, where I engage in continuous learning and open-source collaboration. My long-term goal is to specialize in data science—a field that blends analytical thinking, statistical knowledge, and computational power to extract insights and drive intelligent decision-making.
Driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a desire to contribute meaningfully to the digital world, I am committed to becoming a skilled data scientist and using technology to make a difference in people’s lives.
